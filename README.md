# Predicting-Driver-Lane-Change-Maneuvers-Using-LSTM-and-FEDERATED-Learning
This report examines the efficacy of federated learning (FL) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in the context of video classification. Initially, attempts to implement a TensorFlow Federated environment were unsuccessful, leading to a manual approach using LSTM models across three clients
